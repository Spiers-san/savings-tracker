* Started by opening a new folder named 'Savings Tracker'
* Created 3 new files: index.html,style.css,scipt.js
* Completed the outline of the website (index.html and style.css are complete. JavaScript file not yet started)

* Started to work on the JavaScript file
* Checked all cases of values and got correct responses from the calculator
* Proceeded by adding the animation part of the loading process (Completed)
* As of now frontend completed (Planning to add extra features)
* Wanted to integrate username/password login interface
* Used Firebase to implement this feature
* Uploaded the project in the firebase and customized it and enable email/password authentication
* Mail/Password authentication verified in such way that it accepts only valid email addresses and it sends a verification mail with verification link to verify the user before logging in
* Added 'Forgot password?' feature and 'Remember me' options

* Using Firebase instead of other traditional Database Management Systems as it is more quick with built-in auth and doesn't require any server setup. Most of the verifications are built-in for free so leads to less work.
* Added the buttons for the new features discussed
* Added a new interface that asks the user if they login for the first time, Information regarding the user's income and monthly expenses to create a 'bank-balance'
* Faces a problem where the values updated through the questionnaire are not updated in the main page
